With a user interface based on direct manipulation, Android is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, with specialized user interfaces for televisions (Android TV), cars (Android Auto), and wrist watches (Android Wear). The OS uses touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, and a virtual keyboard. Despite being primarily designed for touchscreen input, it also has been used in game consoles, digital cameras, regular PCs (e.g. the HP Slate 21) and other electronics.

Android is the most widely used mobile OS and, as of 2013, the highest selling OS overall. Android devices sell more than Windows, iOS, and Mac OS X devices combined,[13][14][15][16][17] with sales in 2012, 2013 and 2014[18] close to the installed base of all PCs.[19] As of July 2013 the Google Play store has had over 1 million Android apps published, and over 50 billion apps downloaded.[20] A developer survey conducted in April–May 2013 found that 71% of mobile developers develop for Android.[21] At Google I/O 2014, the company revealed that there were over 1 billion active monthly Android users, up from 538 million in June 2013.[22]

    <h1>BOOTSTRAP</h1>
    <p>Bootstrap is a free collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. In June 2014 it was the No.1 project on GitHub with over 73,000 stars and more than 27,000 forks,[2] and a user base that includes MSNBC and NASA.[3][4]Bootstrap is a free collection of tools for creating websites and web applications.

In computer technology the term (usually shortened to booting) usually refers to the process of loading the basic software into the memory of a computer after power-on or general reset, especially the operating system which will then take care of loading other software as needed.

The term appears to have originated in the early 19th century United States (particularly in the phrase "pull oneself over a fence by one's bootstraps"), to mean an absurdly impossible action, an adynaton.[Booting is the process of starting a computer, specifically in regards to starting its software. The process involves a chain of stages, in which at each stage a smaller simpler program loads and then executes the larger more complicated program of the next stage. It is in this sense that the computer "pulls itself up by its bootstraps", i.e. it improves itself by its own efforts. Booting is a chain of events that starts with execution of hardware-based procedures and may then hand-off to firmware and software which is loaded into main memory. Booting often involves processes such as performing self-tests, loading configuration settings, loading a BIOS, resident monitors, a hypervisor, an operating system, or utility software</p>

    <h1>WEB-TECH</h1>
    <p>HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create Web pages.

HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like <html>). HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like , although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).

A Web browser can read HTML files and compose them into visible or audible Web pages. The browser does not display the HTML tags and scripts, but uses them to interpret the content of the page. HTML describes the structure of a Website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.

HTML describes the structure of a Website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.

HTML elements form the building blocks of all Websites. HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. It can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML Web pages.

Web browsers can also refer to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to define the look and layout of text and other material. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, encourages the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML.[1]SGML-based versus XML-based HTML[edit]


Aside from the different opening declarations for a document, the differences between an HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 document—in each of the corresponding DTDs—are largely syntactic. The underlying syntax of HTML allows many shortcuts that XHTML does not, such as elements with optional opening or closing tags, and even empty elements which must not have an end tag. By contrast, XHTML requires all elements to have an opening tag and a closing tag. XHTML, however, also introduces a new shortcut: an XHTML tag may be opened and closed within the same tag, by including a slash before the end of the tag like this: <br/>. The introduction of this shorthand, which is not used in the SGML declaration for HTML 4.01, may confuse earlier software unfamiliar with this new convention. A fix for this is to include a space before closing the tag, as such: <br />.[67]</p>
